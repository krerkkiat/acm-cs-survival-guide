You will usually be told to use :bash:`nano`, but you also have the following option.

* :bash:`nano`
* :bash:`micro`

* :bash:`vim`

:bash:`micro` is not installed by default on the school servers, but you can install it
only for your user.

* `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_
* `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_
* `Sublime Text <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`_
* `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_
* `Geany <https://www.geany.org/>`_

One quick note on line number. Most of the editor will turn on the line number by default for you.
However, Gedit is not, so you can turn in on via :bash:`Edit->Preferences`.
On :bash:`vim` you can use :bash:`set number` to show line number or :bash:`set nonumber` to turn it off.
