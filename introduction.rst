Introduction
==============================================
It begin when a lot of junior and senior level computer science students can be seen
using nano to editor text on the school server for the project that they have. Even
though the nanot editor is powerful and useful in some aspect, students should not be
confined into the only tool that have been told be used. There are quite many editor
out there like micro that may faciliate the software development remotely greately.

The idea for this guide then begin to form base on the idea of introducing the
more powerful editors to first year computer science students. It is then scale into
a presentaion "CS Survival Guide", and with the suggestion from graduated seniors, the guide
is planed to have more information on the software, tools, and tricks that the graduated senior
found useful.

We hope that you found this guide in some ways be beneficial to you to get started in computer
science major of Ohio University.
