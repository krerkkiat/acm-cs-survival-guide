Introduction
==============================================
The idea for this project began when many junior and senior level computer science
students were seen using nano for large projects. Even though nano can be powerful
and useful in some aspects, students should experiment with the tools they use when
writing code to learn what works best for them. There are quite many editor out
there that may facilitate the software development remotely greatly. For example,
micro, and not to mention vim and emacs.

The idea for this guide then began to form on the idea of introducing the
more powerful editors to first year computer science students. It has since grown into
a full presentation - `"CS Survival Guide" <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iybf_B2hZ4G_OO1sBR0F6j50CJuYcPNC31zsP491o8o/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
After suggestions from previous undergrads, the guide now has more information on the
software, tools, and tricks that the graduates found useful or learned along the way.

We hope that you find this guide to be beneficial to you to as you begin your computer
science major at Ohio University.
