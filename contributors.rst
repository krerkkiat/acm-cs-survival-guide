==============================================
This guide is started by Krerkkiat Chusap, so all the blame should go to him (especially
if you found yourself maintaining this guide).
However, all compliments should go to all the people
that contribute to this guide either directly or indirectly, and whether
their names are mentioned on this page or not.

I (Krerkkiat Chusap) would like to specially thank the following people.

* Dr. Razvan Bunescu, Associate Professor, Advisor
   for being an advisor for the chapter.
   
* Nasseef Abukamail, Associate Lecturer
   for the help in attracting audience for the presentation.

* Samuel Merten, Graduate advisor
   for fully support the idea and its execution.

* Current (2018-2019) officers of OU ACM
   Nathan Steadman (President), Aubree Dix (Vice President), Rory Dunne (Treasurer), Anirudh Sharma (Secretary).

   Without these officers, I would not have time to play around with this idea.

* Austin Crabtree
   for the first round of external (from myself) ideas and presentation suggestion.

* Timothy Steinberger
   for the second round of external ideas, and for heavily revise, and proof read the early version of the guide. Also, he
   add a lot of content into the guide at its early stage.

* Colton Smith
   for the rehearsal of the presentation. His friendly conversation also keep me active in the chapter.
