About This Guide
================
The creation of this guide is inspired by `these documents <http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/>`_, especially
`this one <http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/eecshelp.html>`_ and `this one <http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/new_users/index.html>`_,
that Mr. Tysko has for the new users of the EECS machines.

The guide was almost be written in LaTeX which may be really hard to maintain.
The thank should go to Raymond Hettinger (`@raymondh <https://twitter.com/raymondh>`_) from saving the guide
to be written in LaTeX with one of his `talk <https://youtu.be/T-TwcmT6Rcw>`_ at PyCon 2018 (Cleveland).
