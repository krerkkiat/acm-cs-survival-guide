Running other OSes
==============================================
This is when you have Windows and want to install Linux
for easy access to tool and environment to work on the homework
assignment and project. Serveral options are available.
You may consider trying out more than one of these options
and see which one gives you the best performance.

===============
Virtual Machine
===============

----------
VirtualBox
----------
A free "general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 harware, targeted at server, desktop and embedded use".

----
QEMU
----
A free as in speech emulator. It is capable of emulating multiple architecture types, including x86, x86_64, and MIPS. It does not come with a GUI, but there are some that are available for it.

-------
Hyper-V
-------
A hypervisor built into Windows Professional, Education, and Enterprise editions. It performs very well if you have access to it.

------
VMware

A free (but not open source) virtualizer for x86 hardware.

=========
Dual Boot
=========

Modern Linux distros such as Ubuntu and Fedora include
installers capable of setting up your system to have more
than one OS installed. They will automatically shrink your
Windows partition, and create new partitions on your
hard drive that will contain Linux. Try out a LiveUSB and
make sure your hardware will work with Linux before you
install Linux.
